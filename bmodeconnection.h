 * @class BmodeConnection
 * @brief A class which handle the communcation with the B-mode machine.
 *
 * For the context. The user will perform B-mode freehand scanning using this software. To achieve that, a B-mode
 * ultrasound machine needs to be connected with a frame grabber device (check Epiphan Frame Grabber), and plugged
 * to one of the port of your PC. To make the software more intuitive, it is better to visualize the real time B-mode
 * ultrasound image. The code is practically the same as how we grab a frame from our webcam. So, for testing the
 * software, we can always choose the port to our webcam port, and the software will run just fine.
