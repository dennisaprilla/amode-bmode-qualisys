/**
 * @class VolumeAmodeController
 * @brief For visualization of A-mode signal in 3D environment
 *
 * For the context. The ultimate goal of this software is to visualize A-mode 3D in the 3D space
 * together with the reconstructed volume (bone surface). By gathering- up these two entity into
 * one 3D space, we will be able to navigate the A-mode such that it directed towards bone surface.
 * This class is responsible to do just that. It will stream the A-mode and Mocap data, transform
 * it accordingly so that it represents what the user do in real time.
 *
 * There is one caveat. I plot the A-mode 3d signal with a 3D scatter plot. Every sample in the
 * signal is a 3D point. Sometimes you will see the signal is like a "discrete" dots, not so pleasant
 * to see. To make line in 3D is really difficult to do, so i stick with this.
